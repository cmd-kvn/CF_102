## Wednesday

# truthy and falsey
"this is a thing" "this is not a thing"
var day = 'Wednesday',
    wednesday = 'wednesday';
if (day = 'wednesday') {console.log(this is true)};
prints "this is true"
because it assigns 'wednesday' to var day and thus becomes truthy.

no, NaN, undefined, 0, empty string, null is falsey, everything else? is truthy
